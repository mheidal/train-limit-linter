Version: 1.0.33
Date: 2024-07-09

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.32
Date: 2024-05-30
  Features:
    - Added toggle in general settings to pretend that stations with dynamic limits have limits set
      to 0.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.31
Date: 2024-05-30
  Changes:
    - Hid the checkbox to toggle showing train schedules on all surfaces if there are only trains
      on one surface.
    - If there are only trains on one surface, the schedule report table will always show the
      schedules on that surface, even if the player is not there.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.30
Date: 2024-05-20
  Optimizations:
    - Improved performance by reducing number of queries to the game's API when building the table
      in the Display tab.
  Modding:
    - Compatibility with Logistic Train Network.
    - Compatibility with Cybersyn.
    - Trains belonging to either LTN or Cybersyn will not be displayed in the Display tab. This
      should improve performance when using Train Limit Linter on a map with many of these trains.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.29
Date: 2024-05-20
  Optimizations:
    - Reduced lag when trains traverse space elevators in Space Exploration. The gui will not
      automatically refresh while a train is traversing the space elevator.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.28
Date: 2024-05-06
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when a locomotive was marked as being able to consume fuels from a fuel
      category which contains no fuels.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.27
Date: 2023-11-27
  Changes:
    - Clicking on the train minimap in the train removal modal now opens that train's gui
      (previously it toggled that train for removal).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.26
Date: 2023-11-27
  Changes:
    - If a train group includes more than one schedule (due to excluded keywords in station names)
      then the 'copy trains' button will generate a blueprint for each schedule instead of picking
      one randomly.
    - Improved display of schedules and schedule tooltips.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed error where trains were counted as belonging to a group when they had no locomotive.
    - Fixed crash when a schedule had too many stops.
    - Fixed crash when too many schedules were sorted into a group by exclusion.
    - Fixed double counting of train stop limits if a train visits the same stop more than once.

Date: 2023-11-25

      of the same train group.
    - Added automatic exclusion of temporary stops.
    - Improved display of schedules, with more granular colors indicating excluded train stops.
  Modding:
    - Compatibility with Train Control Signals.
    - Compatibility with Fuel Train Stop.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed incorrect display of schedules with invalid stops (temporary stops terminating at rails
      which had been removed).
    - Fixed excluded/hidden keywords not applying if they were added to the keyword list before 
      version 1.0.20.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.23
Date: 2023-11-25
  Modding:
    - Added compatibility with the TrainGroups mod (by raiguard).
      When generating a blueprint for a train, the new train will share a train group with the
      template train. This behavior can be toggled. This behavior is not guaranteed to work if not
      all trains with a particular schedule are part of the same train group by TrainGroups's
      definition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Some internal refactoring.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.19
Date: 2023-11-16
